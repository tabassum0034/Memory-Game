## Reflection Questions

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.
   [I have not used any outside resources for this project.]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
   [This project was really interesting because this is the first time I have worked on glitch. I also learned to to code in html, javascript, and CSS. While I was coding in javascipt, it looked very similar to C++ which is a cource I am taking right now. So, I am really eager to learn more in these coding languages. I also realized that css is a little bit similar to C++. Among these three coding languages, html amazed me the most because I have mostly learned code that outputs words and numbers. The visual representation of coding really excited me. So I would like to learn more about this coding language. One challange that I faced while submitting this project is where and how to upload this README.md file because there was already code written in the README.md file under glitch. So I decided to copy this whole text after I was done, and paste it on github after I was done. Another problem I faced is that my game was not working properly because it was not changing the colors once you are done with the game, and nothing was happening when you win. It just works when you lose the game. As I was not sure how I can find the solution, I could not fix it.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
  [I would also like to know more ways to publish a website on my github page as it is almost blank. While I was coding, I really liked html because this is the first time I used coding to create something visual. So I would like to know more ways to code in html and make more games. I also want to know if there are other websites that can create a website except wix.com because I already know how to use that. I always like to learn something new because I believe when someone knows many different ways to make something, they would know which one is the most efficient among them.]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   [If I had a few more hours and more knowledge on how to code in html, javascript, and CSS, I would have made the game more fun. If I knew how fun it is to work on html, I would have watched more videos on how to code in html. In addition, I am not sure if I can add more code inside the functions to modify the game a little bit more. So, I did not change the functions and coded as it is written in the prework website. Otherwise I would have used pictures instead of colors as the buttons. My game was not working properly because it was not changing the colors once you are done with the game, and nothing was happening when you win. It just works when you lose the game. So I would like to ask someone how I can fix this problem.]
